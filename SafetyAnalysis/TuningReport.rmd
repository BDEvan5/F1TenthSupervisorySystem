# Introduction

The supervisory safety system has been built and is to be tuned for ideal use.
```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
test_data = read.csv("DataTable.csv")
# knitr::opts_chunk$set(include = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE)

library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

```

# Testing

The following systems have been build:
```{r, fig.height=2}
test_data %>%
  select(avg_times, success_rate, test_number) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=avg_times, y=success_rate, col=test_number, size=10))+
  geom_point()+
  xlim(350, 750)+
  ylim(70, 100)+
  xlab("Average times")+
  ylab("Success Rate")
```
